Mercator4 Result Visualization Tools
------------------------------------

After a job is concluded, the user as access to the following Tabs - [ **Job submission** | **Result tree viewer** | **Result Heatmap viewer** ]

The **Job submission** tab shows in which MapMan top Bins the data is annotated into.
The cork oak data provided is all annotated in the Photosynthesis MapMan Bin. (inser image here)

The **Result tree viewer** tab allows comparison between the number of genes/protein which occupy each Bin for the organism submitted by the user and reference species present in the tree.
It can serve as basis to understant if the user input species has more or less genes/proteins annotated in a specific process when compared to other reference organisms.
This comparison can also be performed between organisms from multiple job submissions.
The cork oak data provided highlights that the XPTO component has X more/less proteins annotated in the XPTO BIN when compared with *Arabidopsis thaliana*.

The **Result Heatmap viewer** tab presents a different visualization option which yelds the same information as in the tree viewer tab, but only for pairwise proteome comparisons.
